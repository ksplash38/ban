	<h4 class="header">Having Trouble Logging In with Login Security? </h4>

</div><div class="row">

	<b>Security refers to preventing unauthorized access to a computer system or network.</b> Internet Banking uses several
	layers of technology to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to the internal network. Internet Banking's
	security professionals manage a sophisticated networking architecture that includes screening routers, filtering routers,
	and firewalls.

</div><div class="row">

	<b>The Internet Banking section is automatically secured/encrypted, but the rest of the Website can be accessed as either
		secure or unsecure.</b>

</div><div class="row">

	Internet Banking is a term for accessing your account information over the Internet. We may refer to it as Internet Account
	Access or use a different name.

</div><div class="row">

	<h4 class="header">What is Multifactor Authentication?</h4>

	<p>Your online security is important to us, as well as providing you easy and convenient banking tools.  Your online banking
		experience may include a new Enhanced Login Security service to further help protect you from identity theft which is known
		in the online security industry as Multifactor Authentication, or MFA.
	</p>
	<p>Authentication is the process used to allow access to only the correct customer.  Without effective authentication controls,
		it is possible for fraudulent users to access your account. We authenticate customers by issuing challenges that only the
		true customer should be able to pass.
	</p>
	<p>Multifactor Authentication means that two or more different types (or factors) of authentication must be passed. By using
		two different factors of authentication, we get a higher assurance that the customer is the intended user.  MFA is
		commonly
		used to protect transactions at ATMs, where your card is something you have, and your PIN code is something you know.
	</p>
	<p>For your convenience, after you successfully authenticate with your User ID, password and Login Security (One-Time
		Passcode (OTP) or Challenge Questions, if available), you may enroll your computer for use in authentication. If you
		choose to enroll your computer, a special Browser Cookie will be present on the system, which will act in place of
		your phone for something you have in your possession.
	</p>
	<p>We recommend you ensure that your browser settings and any antivirus software you have do not delete your cookies
		(data files) so that you are not prompted to provide Login Security (One-Time Passcode (OTP) or Challenge Questions, if
		available) every time you log into Internet Banking.
	</p>

</div><div class="row">

	<h4 class="header">Logging in from a Computer You Normally Use?</h4>

	<p>When you choose to enroll your computer as PRIVATE, a special Browser Cookie will be present on the system, which will
		act in place of your Login Security (One-Time Passcode (OTP) or Challenge Questions, if available).  You will only need
		your User ID and password to access your account information.
	</p>
	<p>If you are still getting prompted to provide your Login Security, then please ensure that you have the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using one of the <a href="#recommended_os">Recommended Operating Systems for Internet Banking</a>
		</li>
		<li>Using one of the <a href="#recommended_browsers">Recommended Browsers for Internet Banking</a>
		</li>
		<li>Browser is not set to delete cookies  Please follow the steps in listed in this help for your respective browser to
			determine if cookies are being deleted</li>
		<li>Any antivirus software is not set to delete cookies
		</li>
		<li>No viruses or malware on your computer
		</li>
		<li>No usage of a proxy server or web accelerator by your internet service provider
		</li>
		<li>If using a computer from work, verify that your office technical department is not automating deletion of cookies
		</li>
	</ul>

</div><div class="row">

	<h4 class="header">Logging in from a Computer You DO NOT Normally Use?</h4>

	When you choose to list your computer as PUBLIC, you will need to provide your User ID, password  and you will be
	prompted to provide your Login Security (One-Time Passcode (OTP) or Challenge Questions, if available) each time you
	log into your account.  We recommend this setting when logging in from a library or school computer.

	<i>**Password</i> refers to your telephone access (audio response system, not Bill Payment) password or the password that
	you selected when you signed up for Internet Banking. We may alternatively use a different name (e.g. "PIN"). If you have

<h4 class="header">ABOUT COOKIES</h4>
</div><div class="row">
			Cookies are small text files on your system, used to keep track of settings or data for a particular site.  Web sites can use cookies to identify a returning user or to pass information between Web pages in a single visit.
			<p>
				There are two types of cookies: temporary and permanent.  Temporary cookies are used and tracked by the browser to pass information and are deleted once the browser is shut down.  Permanent cookies are stored on your system and can be accessed again for multiple visits.  Permanent cookies usually have an expiration date and will be automatically deleted from your system at that time.  Internet Banking uses temporary cookies and may use permanent cookies, but never passes private information through cookies.
			</p><p>
			An example of how Internet Banking uses a temporary cookie is in the demo.  The browser uses the cookie to either show or hide the overview depending on the user's choice.  Every time the demo is used, that cookie will be used and deleted once the demo is exited or the browser is shut down.
		</p><p>
			Internet Banking also uses a different kind of temporary cookie known as a session cookie, a non-persistent cookie, or a pre-expired cookie.  This cookie is used as part of the stringent security measures in Internet Banking to make sure that each page in Internet Banking is not cached or saved on your system.  This means that each page must be retrieved from the Web server.  This cookie is deleted when a user logs or times out of Internet Banking or if the browser window is closed and ensures that another user on the same computer cannot access the previous user's Internet Banking session or information.
		</p><p>
			If you use Enhanced Security, Internet Banking may place a secure permanent cookie on your computer. This secure cookie is unique, and when used in combination with your login information, creates a unique way to identify you to the system. For every login attempt after you add extra security to a computer, this secure cookie is validated along with the login identification you normally enter. This secure cookie is only used to validate your identity and does not contain any personal information.

			<b>Why We Collect Information</b><br>
			When you visit this site, we gather two different types of information, anonymous statistics collected by our web servers through "log files" which help us monitor our website and improve our services; and personal information, such as name, address and phone number, so we can identify you and complete the requests you initiate.
			<br><br>
			<b>How We Collect Information</b><br>
			Anonymous Statistics: We collect and are the sole owner of the following information which is collected from all of our website users. We do not use "cookies" to collect this information. We use log files to collect:
			<ul>
				<li>Internet Provider address of requestor</li>

You always have the option to provide information through another communication method, such as telephone.
			<br><br>
			<b>What Information We Share</b><br>
			We will share your personal information internally for the purpose of performing a transaction requested by you and for administering business.
			When required by law, we will provide information about you to third parties without your consent; for example, to respond to a subpoena or court order, or judicial or regulatory process. Occasionally, we will provide your personal information to third parties who are under agreement with us to help perform your requested transactions. These companies are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information that is provided to them through our website. Your personal information will not be used for any purpose other than to help fulfill your request.
			<br><br>

<h4 class="header">ABOUT JAVASCRIPT</h4>
</div><div class="row">
			JavaScript is a widely accepted, simple programming language that allows a Web site to be more interactive.  Web sites can use JavaScript to perform many actions such has calculations, displaying dynamic navigation, and rotating through banner images.  By using JavaScript, Web sites can be proactive by making a better internet experience.
			<p>
				An example use of JavaScript in Internet Banking is form validation.  Validation is simply enforcing certain rules on different fields.  When presented with a phone number field, JavaScript can alert the user if the phone number format is incorrect or if a value in the field is not a number.  This allows the form to be filled out and submitted correctly the first time.
			</p><p>
			If JavaScript is not enabled, some or all of the Internet Banking features may not work.  In most browsers, JavaScript is enabled through the adjustment in Security Settings.  Please refer to the specific section for your browser by clicking on the link located in the index at the top of the page.

			Before initiating your Internet Banking, we first require that a "secure session" is established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption.  This is a process where the information between our server and your browser is encrypted or scrambled so it cannot be read by unauthorized parties.

			A general indicator that you have entered a secure session is when the URL (web page address)
			in the address bar starts with "https" (note the "s" at the end) rather than "http", your session

<h4 class="header">ABOUT DISPLAY SIZE</h4>
</div><div class="row">
			The content of a Web site is created to be best viewed in a range of display sizes or screen resolutions.  The display size
			maximum is determined by your monitor's maximum display area (by maximizing your browser window) and the display size minimum
			is user controlled by resizing the window to be smaller then the maximum area allowed.
			<p>
				By viewing a Web site at or above the recommended display size or screen resolution all the Web site content can be seen
				without scrolling left to right.  Each Web site will vary with their recommended display size or screen resolution, but the
				most recommended browser display size is 1024 width by 768 height (1024 x 768).
			</p><p>
			Your monitor's display size, sometimes referred to as the desktop area is a setting controlled by your Operating System.
			Please refer to your Operating System documentation on how to determine and change your display size.

			<u><b>Additional Third Party Software (TPV)</b></u>
		</p><p>
		Due to increased security, certain third party toolbars/software may prevent end user access into Internet Banking.  This can also include some types of pop-up blockers. In order to log into Internet Banking, this software may need to be disabled or uninstalled.  Please refer to the third party vendor instructions for information on how to perform these steps.
	</p><p>

		<u><b>Spyware/Adware</b></u>
	</p><p>
		Due to increased security, certain spyware/adware may also prevent access into Internet Banking.  In order to log into Internet Banking, users must remove this type of software from their computer.
	</p><p>
		<b>Spyware</b> is Internet jargon for <b>advertising supported software</b> (Adware). It is a way for shareware authors to make money from a product, other than by selling it to the users. Adware typically reports your Internet surfing habits back to a third party site for data collection purposes.  In order to protect your financial privacy, it may be necessary to install a spyware/adware search tool to determine if your computer has any of this software installed.  If you determine that adware or spyware has been installed on your computer, the software will need to be removed.
