<h3>How we tailor ads:</h3>

<h4>Relationship based advertising</h4>

<p>To help make our advertising informative and useful, we may use information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information or the state in which you bank) to help determine which advertisements or offers to present to you. We will not use any sensitive information about your financial status or situation to target ads to you on the basis or implication of a negative financial status or situation.</p>

<h4>Online Behavioral Advertising</h4>

<p>We or our advertising service providers may use certain information about your activities on our Sites, such as pages visited and search key words entered to help determine which of our advertisements or offers may be of interest to you. We limit our advertising service providers and allow them to access and collect information only for specific purposes.&nbsp; We may use this online information for online and offline advertising.</p>

<h4>Advertising on third party sites and mobile apps</h4>

<p>Memory Bank contracts with advertising companies to advertise our products and services on sites and mobile apps not affiliated with us.&nbsp; We may use Aggregated and De-identified Data and information provided by you to these third party sites and mobile apps to select which of our advertisements or offers may appeal to you, display them to you and monitor your responses.&nbsp; Third Party sites and mobile apps are not subject to this Memory Bank Privacy Policy. Please visit the individual sites and mobile apps for additional information on their data and privacy practices and opt out policies.</p>

<h4>Online Behavioral Advertising on third party sites and mobile apps</h4>

<p>Some of our tailored ads are online behavioral advertising, and may be served using data collected by third party providers. &nbsp; Ads served on our behalf by these companies do not contain unencrypted Personal Information and we limit the use of information by companies that serve our ads. To learn more about this practice and your choices in connection with it, see the section Advertising Choices below</p>

<h4>Advertising Choices</h4>

<p>You may set your choices for advertising in the following ways:</p>

<p><strong>Online Behavioral Advertising:</strong> &nbsp; If you prefer we not use information based on online Site behavior to provide online and offline tailored content and advertising, you may opt out of online behavioral advertising. Opting out also means that the online content and advertising you receive on our non-servicing sites (i.e. before sign-in) will be untailored and will not be based on your online behavior or your relationship with the Bank.</p>

<p>Please note that if you opt out of this advertising, you may still receive untailored advertising from Memory Bank. When accessing online account servicing areas (i.e. after sign-in), such as Online Banking, you may receive tailored content and advertising based on your account relationships.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Advertising on third party sites:&nbsp;</h4>

<h4>Mobile Applications</h4>

<p>Memory Bank&#39;s Mobile Applications for accounts (&quot;Applications&quot;) allows you to access your account balances and holdings, make deposits, transfers and pay bills on your mobile device.&nbsp; This Policy applies to any Personal Information or Other Information that we may collect through the Applications.</p>

<h4>Linking to other sites</h4>

<p>We may provide links to third party sites, such as credit bureaus, service providers or merchants. If you follow links to sites not affiliated or controlled by Memory Bank, you should review their privacy and security policies and other terms and conditions, as they may be different from those of our Sites. Memory Bank does not guarantee and is not responsible for the privacy or security of these sites, including the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of their information.</p>

<h4>Social media sites</h4>

<p>Memory Bank provides opportunities on social media platforms including, but not limited to, Facebook&reg;, Twitter&reg;, YouTube&reg; and LinkedIn&reg; that enable online sharing and collaboration among users who have registered to use them. Any content you post on official Memory Bank managed social media pages, such as pictures, information, opinions, or any Personal Information that you make available to other participants on these social platforms, is subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policies of those respective platforms. Please refer to them to better understand your rights and obligations with regard to such content.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>To protect Personal Information from unauthorized access and use, we use security measures that comply with applicable federal and state laws.&nbsp; These measures may include device safeguards and secured files and buildings as well as oversight of our third party service providers to help ensure that information remains confidential and secure.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Using other aggregation websites</h4>

<p>Other companies offer aggregation websites and services that allow you to consolidate your financial account information from different sources (such as your accounts with us or with other financial institutions) so that you can view all your account information at one online location. To do this, an aggregation provider may request access to Personal Information, such as financial information, usernames and passwords. You should use caution and ensure that the aggregator company has appropriate policies and practices to protect the privacy and security of any information you provide or to which the aggregator company is gaining access. We are not responsible for the use or disclosure of any Personal Information accessed by any company or person to whom you provide your Site username and password.</p>

<p>If you provide your Site username, password or other information about your accounts with us to an aggregation website, we will consider that you have authorized all transactions or actions initiated by an aggregation website using access information you provide, whether or not you were aware of a specific transaction or action.&nbsp; If you decide to revoke the authority you have given to an aggregation website, we strongly recommend that you change your password for the Site to ensure that the aggregation website cannot continue to access your account.</p>

<h4>Making sure information is accurate</h4>

<p>Keeping your account information accurate and up to date is very important. If your account information is incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please use the Contact Us option on our Site, or call or write to us at the telephone numbers or appropriate address for changes that is provided on your account statements, records, online or other account materials. You can also speak to a customer representative at a banking center, your Financial Advisor at the Bank or an account representative.</p>

<h4>Protecting individual health information</h4>

<p>To the extent that we receive, maintain, or process an individual&#39;s protected health information, Memory Bank may disclose that information as authorized by and in accordance with applicable federal and/or state law.</p>

<h4>California Residents</h4>

<p>If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any of our Sites, California law permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted. To make such a request, please send Memory Bank a detailed description of the specific content or information.&nbsp; Please be aware that such a request does not ensure complete removal of the content or information you have posted and that there may be circumstances in which the law does not require or allow removal even if requested. In addition, if you are a California resident California law also permits you to request that we identify the Personal Information we collect and third parties that received the Personal Information for the third parties&#39; direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. To make such a request, please send us a detailed description of the specific content or information.</p>

<h4>Retention Period</h4>

<p>We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<h4>Updates to this Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>This Online Privacy Policy is subject to change. Please review it periodically. If we make changes to the Online Privacy Policy, we will revise the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the top of this Policy.

<h2>Your security is our first priority</h2>

<h3>Protecting your information and banking activity is of utmost importance to MemoryBank.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s why we provide a number of services, policies and procedures to help keep you safe.</p>

<h3>You bank with multiple devices. Your security should go with you on all your devices.</h3>

<p>MemoryBank requires unique, one-time passcodes the first time you access your account from a new mobile device<sup>&Dagger;</sup> or computer.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<ul>
	<li>When you open your account, you will be asked to provide two phone numbers and an email address, one of which will be used to deliver your one-time access code by text message<sup>&Dagger;</sup>, automated voice message or email, each time you log in from a new device.</li>
	<li>If you&#39;re on a device that&#39;s not your own, you will still use a code, which you should choose not to save on the device so that future users are not authenticated, even if they obtain your password.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sticky notes with passwords? Not so secure.</h3>

<p>MemoryBank recommends using our advanced biometrics with your smartphone&rsquo;s fingerprint ID, or use EyePrint ID&trade;<sup>&Dagger;&Dagger;</sup>&nbsp;to access MemoryBank&rsquo;s mobile banking App<sup>&Dagger;</sup>, instead of entering a password each time you log in.</p>

<ul>
	<li>EyePrint ID<sup>&Dagger;&Dagger;</sup>&nbsp;allows you to create an authentication that&rsquo;s equivalent to a 50-character complex password by mapping the unique vein formation in the whites of your eyes and other micro features in and around the eye by simply looking into the camera on your mobile device<sup>&Dagger;</sup>.</li>
	<li>The biometric uniqueness of every user drastically mitigates the odds of successful mass brute force attacks, cannot be shared, and are more resistant to social engineering attacks. For added security, two-factor authentication is required to set up and use biometric authentication.</li>
</ul>

<h3>We brought in the experts. At no extra cost to you.</h3>

<p>MemoryBank has partnered with the security experts at IBM&reg; to offer you an extra layer of security when banking online, and for your other web activity, at no charge to you.</p>

<ul>
	<li>IBM&reg; Security Trusteer Rapport&reg; is online fraud and identity theft protection assistance software that helps protect your online banking identity, password and other information from fraudsters. It helps prevents some types of phishing attacks and malware on your computer, which are the root cause of most financial fraud.</li>
	<li>And as a bonus, it works with other participating retail websites to improve your overall security.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/trusteer-rapport" onclick="return displayThirdPartyAlert(1, this);" target="_blank">Click here</a>&nbsp;for more information about IBM&reg; Security Trusteer Rapport&reg;.&nbsp;To download,&nbsp;PC users <a href="http://download.trusteer.com/V2u3Vabh1/RapportSetup.exe?x-src=republicbank_website" onclick="return displayThirdPartyAlert(1, this);">click here</a>, and Mac users <a href="http://download.trusteer.com/V2u3Vabh1/leopard/Rapport.dmg?x-src=republicbank_website" onclick="return displayThirdPartyAlert(1, this);">click here</a>.</p>

<h3>Use your MemoryBank MasterCard&reg; Debit Card with confidence.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The microchip embedded in your MemoryBank MasterCard Debit Card provides increased protection against fraud. And with ZERO LIABILITY<sup>1</sup>, you won&#39;t be held responsible for any unauthorized purchases. In the case of identity theft, ID THEFT RESOLUTION<sup>1</sup> helps you with credit bureau notification and card replacement.</li>
	<li>In addition, all our clients are automatically enrolled for Fraud Alerts for their MemoryBank MasterCard debit card account.&nbsp; Fraud Alerts include SMS text as well as interactive voice call and email. These alerts, should you receive one, will be identified as coming from Republic Bank rather than our divisional name of MemoryBank. Learn more about MemoryBank Fraud Alerts <a href="fraud_alerts/index.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shop more securely with your MemoryBank Debit Card and Apple Pay&reg; and Samsung Pay&reg;<sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup>.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>When you make a purchase using your MemoryBank MasterCard Debit Card with Apple Pay and Samsung Pay<sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup>, the retailer never sees your card number or security code. The retailer receives only a transaction-specific code to process your payment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The technical&mdash;but very, very important&mdash;stuff.</h3>

<ul>
	<li>MemoryBank digital banking uses 128-bit encryption for online security, versus 40-bit encryption which is standard with many browsers. (Encryption effectiveness is measured in terms of how long the key is&mdash;the longer the key, the more secure.)</li>
	<li>All data exchanged between MemoryBank web banking, both desktop and mobile<sup>&Dagger;</sup>, and mobile banking Apps<sup>&Dagger;</sup> with MemoryBank servers is protected in transit using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</li>
	<li>Mobile and Online Web Banking uses cookies to &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; mobile devices<sup>&Dagger;</sup>, reducing the threat of having a banking session hijacked and manipulated by attackers.</li>
	<li>In Mobile<sup>&Dagger;</sup> and Online Web Banking, no customer information is stored or cached in the user&rsquo;s device or the Web browser cache. Mobile Banking Apps<sup>&Dagger;</sup> use the device&rsquo;s secure storage to host sensitive data.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;">1 Certain terms, conditions and exclusions apply. See the MasterCard Guide to Benefits accompanying your card for more details and a complete explanation of card benefits provided by MasterCard. Excludes Business and HSA cards.</span></p>
